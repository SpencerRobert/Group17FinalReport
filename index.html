 Originally, this extension was very basic. When toggled on, it rendered a semi-transparent grey line that spanned the entire width of the user’s current web page.
 This line would follow the movement of the user’s cursor until it was toggled off, in which it then disapeared until re-enabled. It was simple but made for an effective aid in 
 reading large blocks of text on webpages as it could assist the user in keeping track of the current line they were reading. Just like how it is being moved along this current 
 block of text you are reading.</p></div></div></div></div>
