 In terms of user experience, this HCI artifact accomplished most of the goals we covered in the early stages of this course. 
 It provides good utility, it is efficient to use, safe to use, easy to learn and easy to remember. However, the one goal it fails to reach is the goal of being effective to use.
 In many scenarios this tool is not nearly as effective as it could be. The original developer created a significant constraint for users by failing to incorperate any customization options regarding the reading line.
 This design flaw is confirmed by the existing user feedback on the chrome store - some of which is pictured below:</p>

<p>
In class we learned about questions we needed to ask ourselves when beginning a design project:
</p>

<div class="flip-card">
  <div class="flip-card-inner">
    <div class="flip-card-front">
      <p>Are there problems with an existing product or user experience? If so, what are they?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="flip-card-back">
      <p>
	  Yes, we found that problems existed with the original product. In certain scenarios the default specifications caused the reading line to be:  
	  </p>
	  <ul>
		<li>a size that is inapplicable to the text on the current webpage</li>
		<li>a color that reduces effectiveness on the current webpage</li>
		</ul>
	<p>and we found that constantly lining up the reading line yourself made
	  for a less enjoyable user experience.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<br>

<div class="flip-card">
  <div class="flip-card-inner">
    <div class="flip-card-front">
      <p>Why do you think there are problems?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="flip-card-back">
      <p>
	  We think these problems exist because of the constraint that exists on the reading line - not allowing its properties to be altered by the user.   
	  </p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<br>

<div class="flip-card">
  <div class="flip-card-inner">
    <div class="flip-card-front">
      <p>What evidence do you have to support the existence of these problems?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="flip-card-back">
      <p>
	  The evidence we have to support these problems mainly consists of the user feedback that exists on the Chrome Store. We have also tested the original product and experienced the same issues that were described by other users.
	  </p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<br>

<div class="flip-card">
  <div class="flip-card-inner">
    <div class="flip-card-front">
      <p>How do you think your proposed design ideas might overcome these problems?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="flip-card-back">
      <p>
	  We believed our design ideas would overcome these problems because they provided the users exactly what they asked for - which they reccomended would fix their issues. 
	  </p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<br>

<p>
Once we answered these questions, we had identified the problems and the solutions we needed to implement. We created a storyboard to 
further illustrate our idea:
</p>

<br>

  <select id="selectStory">
    <option value="sb1">Scenario 1</option>
    <option value="sb2">Scenario 2</option>
    <option value="sb3">Scenario 3</option>
  </select>
  
  <script src="static/storyboard.js"></script>

<br><br><br>

<img id="sb1" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SpencerRobert/Group17FinalReport/main/.github/images/sb1.gif"/>
<img id="sb2" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SpencerRobert/Group17FinalReport/main/.github/images/sb2.gif" style="display: none"/>
<img id="sb3" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SpencerRobert/Group17FinalReport/main/.github/images/sb3.gif" style="display: none"/>


<br>


<p>
With our design phase winding up, we began to develop our prototype. Given the time frame of this project, we felt it wouldn't make sense to spend time creating any sort of
low-fidelity prototypes. We dove right into coding and took an evolutionary prototyping approach where we continuously added new features and tested getting closer and closer to the final product. 
The end result was a high-fidelity prototype that looks and behaves very similar to our intended final product. Feasibility and technical issues resulted in some aspects of the designs being changed
however we kept the design principles we learned from class in mind and made good use of them throughout.  
</p>

<h2>System Map</h2>


<div id="state1" class="sticky">State 1</div>

<br><br><br><br><br>

<p style="font-size: 26px;">
The first/initial state of the system is where users will start after downloading and unpacking the extension. In this state the user's Chrome browser tab will appear to be unchanged. From here the
user can start by navigating to the extensions logo to the right of the search bar and click it to see the Improved Reading Line extension. To easily see the current status of the program (toggled on or off)
users can pin the Improved Reading Line icon as seen below:
</p>

<br><br>

<img id="map1" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SpencerRobert/Group17FinalReport/main/.github/images/map1.gif"/>

<br><br>

<p style="font-size: 26px;">
When the reading line is toggled on, the icon will switch images to one with a red line in it. When toggled off the image will not include the red line. 
</p>

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<div id="state2" class="sticky">State 2</div>

<br><br><br><br><br>

<p style="font-size: 26px;">
The user navigates to state 2 of the system when they toggle the reading line on. This is done by simultaneously pressing ctrl + alt + - and pressing the same key combination in this state
will toggle the reading line off and the user will return to the first state. Once in state 2, the default reading line (identical to the one from the original version) will render where
the users mouse is on the webpage. From here the user can use the default reading line if they find it suitable for their current webpage and it will follow the user's mouse vertically along it.
If the user wants to make adjustments to the reading line (line height, color, transparency, shift amount and width in the future) can navigate to the Improved Reading Line icon and click it to open the adjustment interface,
putting the user in state 3 as seen below:
</p>

<br><br>

<img id="map2" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SpencerRobert/Group17FinalReport/main/.github/images/map2.gif"/>

<br><br>

<p style="font-size: 26px;">
From the second state of the system, the user is also able use the freeze command by simultaneously pressing shift + f, this navigates the user to state 4. The freeze command causes the reading line
to freeze in place and it renders a small instruction panel in the top left corner of the web page as seen below:
</p>

<br><br>

<img id="map3" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SpencerRobert/Group17FinalReport/main/.github/images/map3.gif"/>

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>


<div id="state3" class="sticky">State 3</div>

<br><br><br><br><br>


<p style="font-size: 26px;">
In state 3 of the system, the user has the adjustment GUI open which is just a flat menu design containing a few different widgets used to modify components of the extension. These include:
<br>
<ul style="font-size: 26px;">
		<li>a slider to adjust the height of the reading line</li>
		<li>a slider to adjust the width of the reading line (future release)</li>
		<li>a slider to adjust the opacity of the reading line</li>
		<li>a color picker to select the color of the reading line</li>
		<li>a numeric input field to specify the shift amount</li>
</ul>
<br>
</p>
<p style="font-size: 26px;">
Changes made in this state take effect immediately and the interface can be closed by clicking anywhere outside of it as seen below:
</p>

<br><br>

<img id="map4" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SpencerRobert/Group17FinalReport/main/.github/images/map4.gif"/>

<br><br>

<p style="font-size: 26px;">
After closing the adjustment interface, if the user had made any changes to the reading line they would navigate to state 5 of the system where the line is no longer identical to the default one.
Otherwise if no changes were made to the reading line, the user will navigate back to state 2. 
</p>

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>


<div id="state4" class="sticky">State 4</div>

<br><br><br><br><br>

<p style="font-size: 26px;">
The user lands in state 4 after they have executed the freeze command. In this state the user can make use of the shift feature that was added in our redesign. We could not find any good methods of
control in terms of an obvious affordance for this feature, so we injected the instruction panel into the webpage to create that affordance. Simultaneously pressing shift + h can be used to hide the
instruction menu and simultaneously pressing shift + uparrow or shift + downarrow can shift the reading line up and down respectively by the amount specified in the adjustment interface. This can be
seen below:
</p>

<br><br>

<img id="map5" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SpencerRobert/Group17FinalReport/main/.github/images/map5.gif"/>

<br><br>

<p style="font-size: 26px;">
In state 4 the user can unfreeze the reading line by simultaneously pressing shift + f which will navigate them back to state 5 or 2 whether they had already made adjustments respectively. 
When unfrozen the instruction menu will be removed and the reading line will begin to follow the user's cursor as seen below:
</p>

<img id="map6" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SpencerRobert/Group17FinalReport/main/.github/images/map6.gif"/>

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>


<div id="state5" class="sticky">State 5</div>

<br><br><br><br><br>

<p style="font-size: 26px;">
In state 5 the user has adjusted the reading line to their liking and is able to freely move it vertically along the active webpage. Pictured below are examples of users in state 5
using an adjusted version of the reading line that better suits the text they're reading and webpage they're visitng:
</p>

<br><br><br>

<img id="map7" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SpencerRobert/Group17FinalReport/main/.github/images/map7.jpg"/>

<br><br><br>

<img id="map8" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SpencerRobert/Group17FinalReport/main/.github/images/map8.jpg"/>

<br><br><br>

<p style="font-size: 26px;">
In terms of navigating the system, state 5 is identical to state 2, users can:
<ul style="font-size: 26px;">
		<li>Navigate to state 1 by simultaneously pressing ctrl + alt + - to toggle reading line off</li>
		<li>Navigate to state 3 by clicking the Improved Reading Line icon to open the adjustment interface</li>
		<li>Navigate to state 4 by simultaneously pressing shift + f to execute the freeze command</li>
</ul>
